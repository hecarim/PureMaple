Pure Maple is a content management system for MapleStory. 
Our goal with this website is to create a new generation of MapleStory websites, 
with kick-ass functionality, such as user management, posting content, 
user profile and comments and whatnot, as well as an amazing design that will catch the eye of any user. 
Pure Maple is coded in PHP, HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript. We are using several frameworks to help minimize work load. 
All database connections are made using the PHP Data Objects(PDO) driver.
<br /><br />
These are some of the basic features we hope to accomplish implementing: <br />
User Management<br />
Posting Content<br />
User Profiles<br />
User Blogs<br />
Theme Functionality<br />
Much more..
<br /><br />
This readme file will be updated as and when we progress on with the websites development.
